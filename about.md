Hello there, I am Bishwa Hang Rai. I am a software engineer living in *Munich, Germany*.

I work at [Freeletics][freeletics]. I am the lead backend developer driving topics related to architecture, system design, and scalability.
I am part of the cross-functional team called '_Engineering Productivity_', enabling developers to be productive through mentoring and on-boarding, automation of mundane tasks (CI, scripts), and keeping the tech stack continuously updated (gems, libraries).

In the past, I worked at [Experteer][experteer].


I have "_Master's in Computer Science_" from [Technical University of Munich][tum]. I wrote my [Master's Thesis][master-thesis] on behavioral analysis of malware, while working as _Research Assistant_ at [Seclab, UC Santa Barbara][seclab].  
I did my "_Bachelor's in Computer Engineering_" from [Institute of Engineering, Pulchowk Campus][ioe].
